# FireNet-LightWeight-Network-for-Fire-Detection
In our paper we showed results on two datasets: One is our own dataset with images randomly sampled from our self-shot fire and non-fire
videos.
Other dataset we used for testing is Foggia's dataset, which can be find on this link (https://mivia.unisa.it/datasets/video-analysis-datasets/fire-detection-dataset/).
